# (05)*********************Supervised and unsupervised learning in Machine Learning*****************

# ----How will a Machine learn?
# ----ML Algorithms----ML with Problem Understanding!----In Machine Learning ,data and techniques is important but equally important the type of problem(Supervised/Unsupervised)

# ----Steps in a Typical Machine Learning Problems
# --(1)-Problem Identification
# --(2)-Data Collection and Validation
# --(3)-Model Building
# --(4)-Feedback

# ----What is Supervised Learning?----Machine knows something beforehand
# ----Supervised Learning---Teaching the Machine
# --(1)-Already Tagged Data
# --(2)-Features and Labels present
# --(3)-Classification---Calssify which label a given set of features belog to!
# --(4)-Regression-------Find out the value of the label using previous data!

# ----What is Unsupervised Learing?----All machine knows is the data in front of it. No Features! No Labels
# ---Unsupervised Learning---Teaching the machine
# --(1)-Data Not Already Tagged
# --(2)-Features and labels not present
# --(3)-Training not done
# --(4)-Clustering and Association
# ----Clustering----Discover the inherent grouping in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behaviour.
# ----Association---Association rule learing problem. such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y
