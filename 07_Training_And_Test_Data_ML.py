# (07)***********************Training and Test Data in Machine Learning*************************

# -----first of all we take some values and assign the algorithm 
# -----then we take 60 to 70% data appling as a test if the test data is returning correct values then our algorithm is correct and accurate if returning values are not correct then the algorithm is not correct and accurate
# ----thats why we categories the data in to two parts------train and test data
